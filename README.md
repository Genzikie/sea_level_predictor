# Rise in Sea Level
This project analyzes the rise in sea level based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and creates a visualization of the data using Python and its libraries.

# Data
The data for this project is obtained from the EPA website, which provides information on the sea level change from 1880 to 2014. The data is stored in a CSV file named "epa-sea-level.csv".

# Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
scipy

# Code
The code uses pandas to import the data and matplotlib to create a scatter plot of the sea level data. It then uses scipy to calculate the line of best fit for the entire dataset and the data from 2000 onwards.

The resulting visualization displays both the line of best fit for the entire dataset and the line of best fit for the data from 2000 onwards.
